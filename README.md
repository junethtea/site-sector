# 📡 Site Sector Generator (Global Edition)

**Site Sector Generator** is an advanced, high-performance QGIS plugin designed specifically for Radio Network Optimization (RNO) and Network Performance (NPO) Engineers. It automates the generation of cellular site polygons (wedges) and features a built-in audit engine for LTE PCI Modulo analysis.

## 🔥 Key Features

### 1. 🚀 Enterprise-Grade Performance (National Data Ready)
* **Lightning Fast:** Optimized with Bulk Insert rendering to handle National-scale datasets. Generates hundreds of thousands of sectors.

### 2. 🎨 Dynamic Band Styling
* Automatically detects and styles unique frequencies/bands from your raw data using smart Regex parsing (e.g., extracting "1800" from "LTE_1800_MHz").
* **Auto-Decrement Radius:** Intelligently reduces the sector radius for overlapping multi-band layers so every frequency is perfectly visible without manual adjustment.

### 3. 🚨 PCI Modulo Audit Engine
* Instantly visualize LTE interference by generating thematic site sector base on **PCI Modulo 3 (RS Interference)** or **Modulo 6 (PSS Interference)**.

### 4. 🌍 Multi-Format Export with Preserved Thematics
* **ESRI Shapefile (.shp):** Exports geometry and automatically generates a companion `.qml` file to permanently lock your thematic colors.
* **MapInfo (.tab):** Direct native export for MapInfo users.
* **Google Earth (.kml):** Exports 3D-ready KMLs that automatically include an embedded, on-screen floating legend.
