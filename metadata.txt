about=Site Sector is an advanced productivity tool designed for RF/NPO Engineers in the Telecommunications sector. It automates the generation of cellular site polygons (wedges) and features a built-in audit engine for network optimization. Key features include:
    * Dynamic Band Styling: Automatically detects and styles unique frequencies/bands using smart Regex parsing.
    * Auto-Decrement Radius: Intelligently reduces sector radius for overlapping multi-band layers to ensure full visibility.
    * PCI Modulo Audit: Instantly visualize LTE interference by generating thematic site sector based on PCI Modulo 3 (RS), Mod 6 (PSS).
    * Multi-Format Export: Seamlessly export generated sectors data to ESRI Shapefile (.shp), MapInfo (.tab), or professional Google Earth (.kml) formats with auto-embedded floating legends.
